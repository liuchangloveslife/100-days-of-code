According to the rule, my commitment has failed. But I wish has less regret. I will still continue this challenge.

Accessibility means make page accessible for broad audience. Using appropriate grouping tags ,text alternatives and well-organized code structure to help people with visual/audio impairments. Something interesting is that SEO could regard as improvement of accessibility.
Semantic grouping tags include header, nav, main, section, article, footer. Semantic individual meaning tags include figure, audio, time. Special for input tags include label, fieldset, date. has sufficient contrast, set keyboard focus. Check xmind notes for details.

object literal: (a,b) => {a,b}

defining function in property of object, : function could be omited

class syntax: special function, when use with new, invoke constructor to instantiate, use with get/set to write getter/setter, notice their usage

require() and import:import will get portion of exported function/variable; import substract from "math_functions"

export: export const ... or export {...} in exported file

import *: import * as object_name from "file_path"

quantity specifier: `{min,max}`, `{min,}`, `{,max}`, `{times}`

character: `?` for lazy match or maybe not existance

lookahead: positive `(?=...)`, negative `(?!...)`

capture group: define `(...)`, use with `\1-`, eg. "code free".replace(/(\w+)\s(\w+)/, '$2 $1'); //returns "free code"

make sure pairs of parentheses/brackets/braces/quotes

when using quotes in string，make sure the string won’t end up earliy, using escape character

`=` is assignment operater, `==/===` is equality/strict equality operater

`var varName = function_name;` means the varName is now the function, `var varName = function_name()` means the varName is assigned the function return value

when function has more than one parameter, input arguements in wrong order will cause runtime error(types of data won’t match), or logical error(can’t get the intended ouput)

index of string or array starts from 0, ends in .length-1, ignore the index-0 or request index-.length will occur errors

when we need reinitializing variable in loop, we need make sure the variables or loop counters are assigned correctly

### Day 25: 2019-7-20

1hr42min 12 exercises on FCC

make infinite terminal condition: make sure loop counter increment/decrement in correct direction, don’t reset loop counter or index in loop code

using bracket notation to access/modify elements in an array

add items to arrays, .push() at end of the array, .unshift() at begining of the array, could have more than one argument

remove one item from arrays: .pop() from end of the array, returns removed element; .shift() from begining of the array, returns removed element.

Array.splice(p1,p2[,p3]): manipulate arrays by removing/replaceing, returns removed or modified array, p1: the index to start, p2: the number of items to remove, p3: replacement to replace removed fragment

Array.slice(p1,p2): extract items from array, returns an array of ectracted items; p1-start index of extracting(inclusive), p2-end index of extracting(exclusive)

...: speard operater, unpacked items list, [...arr] mean copy of the arr, [item1,item2,...arr, item3] means combine array to form new one

multiple-level array need tidy order to show relationship of layers

objects are collections of key-value pairs/pieces of data mapped to unique identifiers we call properties or keys

using bracket notation returns whether is not `undefined` or object.hasOwnProperty(elem) to examine whether has the elem

`delete` remove the property from object, `delete foods.oranges;`

`for...in`: iterate all properties in object, `for(let user in users){if(users[user]['online']==true){counter++;}};`

`Object.keys(obj)`: returns an array containing all keys of properties in object, don’t have speceifed order

 computer algorithm: sequence of steps to achieve a particular outcome; break problem down in many chunks, then solve each chunk one by one. 

**whole code will be finded in xmind notes.**

convert Celsius to Fahrenheit: `let fahrenheit = celsius*9/5 + 32`;

Reverse a String: 1)splite the string to an array.2)reverse the array.3)join the array together, `str.split('').reverse().join('');`
